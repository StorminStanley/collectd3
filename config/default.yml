# Server configuration
# --------------------
# Used for server configuration.
# Will not be shown at client, so it's safe to store session key (or something like that) in this 
# section.
server:
  # Server port
  # For port <1024, you should run it as root
  port: 9000
  # Static directory
  # Path to a directory of your static data (html, client-side js, styles, images)
  static-directory: web
  # Data directory
  # Path to a directory of your collectd data. This directory should contain list of subdirectories 
  # (one for each host with hostname as a name of subdirectory).

  # When false, suppress output of console.info

  # Last timestamp
  # We need this on development to display meaningful data on offline rrd files. On real-time system
  # it should be set to false

  # Node types
  # List of types of hosts we are working with. For now, there are two use-cases: we may refer to 
  # this types in another config section (like heatmap or aggregate-storage) to limit a list of 
  # hosts it should fetch, or we may want to define which disk or partition we want to show at
  # details view. 
  # For second use-case, only first appearance of specific property matters. For example, if we 
  # have two types of identical host (like we have with storage and all-storage) and they both have 
  # different partition property, server picks first and ignore second.
